            <p>
            I began playing chess at the age of 6. I was quickly a staple at my school's chess club, enjoying both the competitive and social sides to the game.
            Soon I started playing in tournaments, and so began my chess career. Some of my greatest accomplishments in life have come through chess.
            In middle school, my school team won the National middle school chess championship. In high school, I received the title of candidate master.
            Nowadays what continues to attract me to the game is the way it pushes me intellectually. I treat every chess position as a puzzle for me to solve.
