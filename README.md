## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was of doing something with basketball statistics online. So first like scraping the relevant data, and analyzing it hopefully finding something interesting.
Like for example, I've always wondered at the end of the game when one team is down 3 points and they have the ball is it a more successful strategy for the
other team to foul or to let them attempt a 3? And then maybe depending on how long it takes me to do the earlier parts, I could work on visualizing my data.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?


## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at this time.
