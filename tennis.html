            Short History
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started playing tennis at the age of 7, a bit after I started chess. Until high school, my main exposure to tennis came during the summer
            when I would go to the Penn Tennis Summer Camp. Nonstop rallies in the intense heat and long Gatorade breaks practically summarizes my summers.
            Also throughout my childhood whenever my dad and I got an opportunity to hit the courts, we did. Only recently have I gotten to the point where
            I can actually hang with him on the court. Come high school I joined my school's varsity team. Most of the matches I played were doubles and
            that gave me the opportunity to form bonds with my partners. We made it to states every year, but also got knocked out in the first round every year.
            I don't get a chance to hit too much in college, but come summer I'm looking to get back into tennis!
