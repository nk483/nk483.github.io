Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I found a basketball stats dataset to use, I uploaded it to SQL, and then since it only gave me season-by-season data rather than aggregate data,
I made a new table that aggregated the data.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I am just starting to make the website.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Cleaning the SQL data and aggregating it took very long computationally, but that is over now.
