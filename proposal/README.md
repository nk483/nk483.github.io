# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

To Foul or not to Foul?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that visualizes basketball data.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will scrape NBA data, then analyze it, and finally present my finding in an aesthetically pleasing manner. I was hoping to look at some situations
that arise frequently in basketball and see if I could analyze them using the data I scrape. For example, at the end of a basketball game where one
team is up by 3 but the other team has the ball, the question arises should the leading team foul or let the other team shoot the 3. I was hoping
to empirically look at how teams have fared either when fouling or not. I was thinking I would scrape data from NBA.com or other datasets using python
then use python/sql to analyze the dataset and then code a website in html/css/javascript to present it.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Scrape some form of basketball data from the web.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Scrape basketball data from the web and analyze it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Scrape basketball data from the web, analyze it, and create a website presenting it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to scrape data as well as find the right data set for this task.
