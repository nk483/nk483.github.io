            Nalin's Favorite Sports to Watch
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Basketball
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Basketball, as with most sports (but not all!), I root for my hometown team, the 76ers! I've got us as the dark horse to win it all this year,
            if we can find our chemistry. My favorite sixer is quickly becoming the rookie Matisse Thybulle who always seems to know what to do on defense.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Football
        </h2>
        <p>
            My favorite football team to watch is (surprise) the Seahawks! When I was really young their blue and neon green jerseys caught my eye,
             and I've stuck with them ever since. I've got the Seahawks too as a dark horse candidate to win it all, now that our O-line has learned how to block
             and we've got Jadaveon Clowney hounding opposing QBs.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Tennis
        </h2>
        <p>
            Though there are many other sports that I watch from time to time, tennis is the only other one that makes
            the cut as one that I consistently watch. My favorite player is Rafael Nadal, because, like me, he plays lefty and hits a two-handed
            backhand. I have definitely looked to emulate my tennis game after his. My dad is a huge Federer fan, so the many Fed-Rafa battles
            over the years have been greeted with excitement in the Khanna family.
